{T}He great naturalist, to expresse the excellencie of the nature of Bees, saith thus, *Inter omnia insecta principatus apibus et jure præcipua admiratio; solis ex eo genere hominum causam genitis/*. Of all *insecta/* the Bees are chiefe, and worthily to bee most admired; beeing the only thinges of that kinde, which are bred for the behoofe of men. The later part of which saying although the delicat Silk-worme have else-where disproved, and is now setting foot in this land, here also to except against it; yet must shee needs confesse the former, and, when shee is come, yeelde the precedence to the laborious Bee, as to hir elder sister; which as in time, so in vertue is before her. For the fruite of the Silke-worme serveth onlie to cover the bodie; but the fruite of the Bee to nourish and cure it: that is to bee applied outwardly, this to be inwardly received: that for comlinesse and conveniency, this for health & necessitie. But, to omit comparison, the worke and fruit of the little Bees is so great and wond- [cw:erfull,][a2]

derful, so comely for order and beauty, so excellent for art and wisdome, and so full of pleasure and profit; that the contemplation thereof may well beseeme an ingenious nature. And therefore not without cause are the Bees called the Muses birds.\*Var.l.3.ca.16./*/
The love of which did so ravish *Aristomachus/* and *Philiseus/*, that, as *Plinie/* reporteth,\*Nat hist.li.II./*/ they were pleased to spend most of their time in this pleasing busines. *Nequis/* (saith hee) *miretur amore carum captos Aristomachum Solensem duodesexaginta annis nihil aliud egisse; Philiscum vero Thasium in desertis apes colentem Agrium cognomimatum: qui ambo scripsere de his/*. *Aristotle/* thought his *Historia animalium/* unperfect, unles he had inserted a tract of the nature of Bees: of which hee discourseth more at large, then he doth of any other living creature. *Plinie/* likewise in his *Naturalis historia/* is very copious in this argument. Besides whom, divers other haue written therof: as *Columella, Varro, Palladius, Averroes/*. Yea the learned and grave fathers of the Church *S. Ambrose/* and *Isidore/* have thought it a subject fit for their pens. Unto which I may adde infinite others of later times both in Latine & English; which haue written many things of these admirable creatures. 
But in al their writings they seeme unto me to say little out of experience, and to rely more upon the relation of others; then anie certaine [cw:know-]

knowledge of their owne. Notwithstanding in some of them, specially in *Aristotle & Plinie/*, are scatered many true and good observations; which, being found agreeable to experience, I have here and there, as occasion required, for authority and ornament interlaced. But the later writers, imitating the ancient where they thought good, choosing some of their directions and refusing others, doe, for the most part, unluckely light upon the worse: so that being compared, they are no way matchable unto them; whome by the advantage of time they might haue surpassed. Among which *Georgius Pictorius/* a learned Physitian deserveth best, as having taken most paines in perusing the ancient authors, and gathering their matter into his methode. Whom one *T. H./* of London translating word for word into English as wel as he could, concealing the authors name, adventured to publish in his owne name. These and the like when a scholar hath thoroughly read, he thinketh himselfe throughly instructed in these mysteries: but when he commeth abroad to put his skil in practise, every silie woman is ready to deride his learned ignorance. 
Wherefore considering howe greate the vertue and efficacy of the fruite of these \v.c.10.p.3/ creatures is, both for the preserving, and restoring of mans health, I thought it not amisse to spend some by-time for my recreation, in sear-[cw:ching][a3]

ching out the nature & properties of Bees, that I might know how to do good unto them, which are so good for us, and what is the due & righte ordering of these delightful, profitable, and necessary creatures. And having to my contentment, though to my cost, in some sort attained my desire, I was incited, even by the rule of charity, to communicate that to my neighbours & countrymen, which I haue found so beneficiall to my selfe: so that the reader may now freely reape the fruite of that, which the author hath deerly sowen vnto him.
\*De generat.an.l.3.c.10/*/ The Philosopher intreating of the breeding of Bees, professeth himselfe uncertaime of their sex: and therefore, willing in this uncertainty to grace so worthy a creature with the worthier title, he every where calleth their governor *βασιλεύς/*, or *Rex/*. As many as followed him, searching no farther then he did, were contente to say as he said. So that I am enforced (unlesse I wil choose rather to offend in *rebus/* then in *vocibus/*) by their leave and thine (learned reader) to straine the common signification of the word *Rex/*, and, in such places, to translate it *Queene/*, sith the males heer beare no sway at al, this being an *Amazonian/* or Feminine kingdome. v. \*V.c.4.n.20.&22./*/
In distinguishing the times of the yeer, I use the Astronomical months as most natural and fitting to my purpose; beginning each month with the day that the sun entreth into his sign, [cw:and]

& giuing the name of each signe to his month; because the most notable thinges concerning Bees, which are to be observed in them or to be done for them fal out in the beginnings of these months. Where note that by the name of each month, is commonly understood the first day of the same month (namely wheresovever this preposition *at/* is set before it) except only where it followeth the preposition *in/* or *after/*, or otherwise the sense doth plainely shew that it is spoken of the whole month. 
I am out of doubt that this book of *Bees/* wil in his infancy be hidden in obscurity as the book of *tropes and figures/* did for a while go unregarded, without friends or acquaintance: But as that did by litle & litle insinuat it selfe into the love & liking of many schooles, yea of the Vniversity it selfe, where it hath been both privatly and publikley read (a favour which this mother doth seldome afford to hir owne children, least happily shee should seeme too fond over them) so this will in time travaile into the most remote partes of this great kingdome of greate *Britaine/*, and be entertained of al sorts both learned and unlearned: although the *Muses/* birdes are fittest for the *Muses/*, & the knowledge of their long-hidden secrets was cheifly published for the *Muses friends/*. *Quibus me, quic quid sum, & studia mea dico. Wotton. Jul. II. 1609./*
