# Bee-ing Human
A master repo for all things *Bee-ing Human*, including data, auxiliary scripts, and auxiliary tools. Separate repos will be created and linked to for production elements of the project (i.e., web portal, TEI data, etc.)

## About

*Bee-ing Human* is an interdisciplinary research gathering researchers and practitioners from literary studies, musicology, digital humanities and biology (animal behaviour). It centres on a seventeenth-century apiculture book, Charles Butler's *The Feminine Monarchy of Bees*, using it both as an object of study and as a departure point to contrast the early modern knowledge and culture around bees and beekeeping with the latest research in animal behaviour and emotion. Literary scholars will study and edit Butler's original text, musicologists will study the compositions included in Butler's writing, as well as respond with new compositions and reinterpretations of the sound of bees and research results; biologists, inspired by Butler's work, will work on the emotional states of bees, and Digital Humanists will create the final output, a digital bee-book for the 21st century, that will gather all the material and research produced during the project, as well as create digital experiments to communicate the research methods employed by the different disciplines. Alongside this disciplinary research, we will record, document, and present our own interdisciplinary process, as bees with different roles working together for the good of the colony.

## Contributing

### Main Branch
Protected and can only be pushed to via pull requests. Should be considered stable and a representation of production code.

### Dev Branch
Should be considered fragile, code should compile and run but features may be prone to errors.

### Feature Branches
A branch per feature being worked on.
